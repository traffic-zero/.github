# ðŸš¦ Traffic Zero

Welcome to the **Traffic Zero Organization**! This organization hosts all projects, experiments, and research related to multi-agent systems for adaptive traffic control, smart city simulations, and intelligent transportation solutions.

## Our Mission
To design, simulate, and optimize **multi-agent traffic control systems** using state-of-the-art reinforcement learning, multi-agent coordination, and real-world traffic data.  
We aim to improve urban mobility, reduce congestion, and enhance road safety through automated decision-making systems.
